                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    I first started officially coding in 10th grade, when I took AP CS A, but I already had some experience, as I had 
                    coded with Scratch in the past, and I did a project in 8th grade that involved some coding in Python. Near the end of 
                    10th grade, I was accepted for an internship where I would train several deep learning models, so in order to 
                    prepare for this, I relearned Python, and took several Coursera courses to learn how to create Convolutional Neural 
                    Networks (CNNs). In Junior year, Menlo's CS curriculum changed, so I took CS2, and after my experience in 
                    applying CS in a real world use, this felt much easier for me. This year, I am taking both AT CS and App Design 
                    and Development to further expand my CS knowledge.
